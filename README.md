# Windows93-Docs-V3

Welcome to the most complete unofficial set of documentation pages available documenting windows 93, version 3.

## Build

Luckily, windows93-docs-v3 is a static application (no node.js or other server-side things), so all you need to do is download the code/docs and spin up your web server! (everything is in docs/ directory)  
Unfortunately this means an internet connection is required initially to download the docsify-js script.
